  Description: Bare Pu-240 Jezebel Benchmark
  Case:        PU-MET-FAST-002
  Written By:  Paul Romano
  Date:        9/1/2011
  ==========================================

  NOTE: The original specification gave an atom density of 1.3722 x 10^-3 for
  Ga. Since the ENDF/B-VII cross sections with MCNP do not have natural Ga, it
  has been broken up into individual isotopes according to IUPAC recommended
  isotopic abundances as follows:
  
  Ga-69 (60.108%)
  Ga-71 (39.892%)
